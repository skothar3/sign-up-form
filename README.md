# sign-up-form

Here I will be practicing working with HTML forms and form validation by creating a fake sign up form (Odin project ref: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form).

My completed project can be viewed here! I implemented fluid font-sizing and custom form validation that verifies inputs and password matching before allowing submission.
